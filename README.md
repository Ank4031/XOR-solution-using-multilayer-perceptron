# XOR-solution-using-multilayer-perceptron

In this we have created two functions to train the perceptrons. 
The trainHidden function is used to train the 4 perceptrons used in the hidden layer and  trainOutput function is used to train the one percetron we have in our outer layer.
the weights for all the perceptrons are first trained and then the output for the xor operation is calculated.
